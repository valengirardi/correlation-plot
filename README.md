# Correlation Plot for Anaerobic Digesters

## Overview

This repository contains code for generating correlation plots of variables related to anaerobic digesters. Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to evaluate the strength and direction of the relationship between two quantitative variables. In the context of anaerobic digesters, correlation plots can provide insights into which parameters are positively or negatively correlated, helping to understand their interdependencies.

## Contents

data/: This directory contains sample data sets related to anaerobic digesters. These data sets are used for demonstration purposes in generating correlation plots.
Correlation_Plot.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code for creating correlation plots using the provided data sets. It includes explanations and visualizations to interpret the correlation between different variables.
requirements.txt: This file lists all Python dependencies required to run the code. You can install these dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Getting Started

## To generate correlation plots on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Correlation_Plot_Anaerobic_Digesters.git.
Navigate to the cloned directory: cd Correlation_Plot_Anaerobic_Digesters.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebook Correlation_Plot.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data sets and generate correlation plots.
Data

The sample data sets provided in the data/ directory contain various parameters relevant to anaerobic digesters, such as temperature, pH, substrate concentration, gas production rate, etc. These data sets are synthetic and intended for demonstration purposes. For real-world applications, replace them with your own data.

## Results

The correlation plots generated by the code will illustrate the relationships between different variables in the anaerobic digester data. Positive correlations (close to 1) indicate that the variables tend to increase or decrease together, while negative correlations (close to -1) indicate that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease. A correlation close to 0 suggests no linear relationship between the variables.
